Understanding the discourse of a text is beneficial to several NLP end tasks. My own work supports this statement, but also finds that most theories and models ignore that discourse is often ambiguous and subjective. I propose a new dataset and several experiments to explicitly focus on understanding these multiple interpretations and how they are influenced by the biases of the reader.
