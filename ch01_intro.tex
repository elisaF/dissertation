\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

This dissertation examines traditional notions of discourse, and probes how these can be improved to reflect real-world use in more subjective settings. 

In my completed work, I explore how existing discourse theories can help NLP end tasks. I focus on coreference as a marker of salience for an information extraction task, and on embedding rhetorical relations (in the style of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST); \citet{Mann:1988}) for an authorship attribution task. Both experiments confirm a wealth of prior work showing that discourse is helpful on downstream NLP tasks. However, my subsequent work attempting to annotate discourse structures, both in a supervised and unsupervised fashion, reveals several issues with existing discourse theories. First, discourse is described only from the perspective of the writer (not the reader) which can be problematic to infer; second, the bias of the annotator is not accounted for; third, only a single label is allowed to unambiguously describe the relation type between two propositions. 

For the proposed work, I strive to address these three shortcomings. In line with the theoretical work presented in \citet{Asher:2018}, I assert discourse can be judged from the point of view of the \emph{reader}. Further, this third party reader is \emph{biased}, and their personal beliefs and preferences help determine which label they select. As a result, the discourse relation between two propositions can have \emph{multiple}, valid labels. I intend to operationalize parts of this theory by creating a new dataset and new tasks that embrace the ambiguity and subjectivity of discourse. Because these two qualities of discourse are more frequent and easier to identify in conversations, I focus on dialogues instead of monologues (such as news articles) and on speech acts instead of rhetorical relations.
